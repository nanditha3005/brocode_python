#if __name__==__main__  ===> This is a common Python idiom used to check whether a Python script is being run directly or imported as a module into another script.
#                            (this script can be imported OR run standalone) 
#                            Functions and classes in this module can be reused
#                            without the main block of code executing


print((__name__))                   #__main__
